The odds are stacked against you, for, even if you do not die of thirst, there are still formidable dangers to overcome. And if you do survive to reach civilization, your adventure is only just beginning since you must round up a crew and sail in search of Skarvench and avenge his tyranny. But will you be able to thwart his most evil and blackguardly scheme ever: to kidnap the beautiful young Queen of Glorianne?|
